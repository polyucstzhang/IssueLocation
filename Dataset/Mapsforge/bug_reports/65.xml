At the moment the only supported location source in the AdvancedMapViewer is the GPS sensor. Handling of other sources like cell tower or Wi-Fi signals is not yet included.

Therefore the AdvancedMapViewer should be enhanced to support all location sources as described in the official Android developer documentation: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/location/obtaining-user-location.html

I have just applied the patch and committed everything in revision 1112 , after some minor changes. First of all i don't like the idea to change the zoom level (especially not to a hard coded value). Second, i modified the method to select the location fix with the best accuracy (your code just took the first available location).

I have tested the feature on a Milestone 2 device and it worked as it should. Translations for -fi and -it are still missing, but they will come soon i hope.

Since revision r1199 the AMV now uses also the best available location provider for showing and following the current position on the map.

Status: Fixed
