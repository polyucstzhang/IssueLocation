Hi to everybody!

I'm having a problem with the class ArrayItemizedOverlay/Drawables and the MapView. I want to draw on the map a few different icons, around 10, but i always get an error(ERROR/AndroidRuntime(296): java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget). But if I decrease the amount of ArrayItemizedOverlay/Drawables, it's fine.

So...could somebody say to me what I'm doing wrong? Maybe it's not possible to do it :S I've around 15 items at the 'itemList' that owns each ArrayItemizedOverlay.

Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/issues/detail?id=243

This happens because you probably create an Overlay for every item.
Try creating only one overlay 

new ArrayItemizedOverlay(null, getBaseContext());

with null als defaultMarker and afterwards different MarkerItems with different Drawables
new OverlayItem(point, title, snippet, marker)
which you add to the overlay

the error occurs because you ran out of memory

Sorry, it seems that I forgot to answer back this. My problem happened because I was using more than one Overlay, as @dassrock said. It worked like a charm. So @edwinbol, just use new OverlayItem(point, title, snippet, DRAWABLE); It works.
