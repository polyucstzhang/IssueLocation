Hello,

the most files (maybe all) on ftp.mapsforge.org are strongly outdated. For example Germany is generated at the 4th February 2013. 

I found no information, that the automatic update will be stopped, so I expect a little bit newer files there, or are I'm completley wrong?

I'll apreciate if this could be checked, as I like the generated files very much!

Thanks in advance,
DW

The data available at ftp.mapsforge.org (and download.mapsforge.org) are hosted by Freie Universit√§t Berlin (FUB). This was totally fine when Thilo and I were studying/employed at the FUB. But since I graduated last year there is no one left at the FUB who is actively involved in the mapsforge project. A few days agao, Thilo and I had a private discussion about the future of the ftp.mapsforge.org service: we came to the conclusion that we have to shut it down in the near future. However, we are aware that such a service is essential, so we hope that the community can manage to setup something similar. There will be a separate mail on the mailing list discussing this topic.

Before shutting it down, is it possible to get some information from you to perhaps continue your work?
