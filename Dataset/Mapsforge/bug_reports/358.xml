What steps will reproduce the problem? 1.Start basic sample map (berlin.osm.map)
2. zoom in enough to be able to slide for a long time staying on the map
3. slide as quickly as possible from one border to another border of the map

On my Sony Xperia Acro S with android 4.0.3 Application crash... Logcat show a  keydispatchingtimedout error, which is probably linked with CPU usage. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? r2102 , on android 4.0.3. I was not able to reproduce the issue on an AVD.

I don't know why (I'm a beginner in android development), but my logcat do not show the keydispatchingtimeout error anymore (I only rebooted the phone but it's not the first time I try this so I'm quite surprised)... 

Anyway, there is still approximately the same issue, but now the application do no crash but only freeze indefinitely... (Sample application do not respond, would you like to close it?)

On logcat, I've threadid=3: reacting to signal 3
Wrote stack traces to '/data/anr/traces.txt'

Corresponding file is attached.

I'll try on another phone ASAP.

Regards

I also have this problem.
I used the latest version ( r2016 ).
the app freezes when I slide quickly. 
Logcat show a  keydispatchingtimedout error.
I tested on three smart phones:
nexus s android 4.0.4
samsung SII android 4.0.4 
htc rhyme S510b android 2.3.5
they all have this problem.
I don't have this problem when I use 0.3.0.
