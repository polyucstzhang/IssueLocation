The HH routing algorithm will be exported as a web service in the near
future. We will also have an overlay API that allows to display routes on
an Android device. We need to integrate this functionality. The
AdvancedMapViewer should allow to calculate and display a route between two
(or more) selected points using the web service.

I think it would be better to support different web services, not only the one at tom.mapsforge.org. But if you have no time to work on it, we should be honest and close it now to avoid disappointing somebody who waits for it.
