When the TileCache is used a lot, many tiny files are generated. This slows down the loading a lot.
Possible solutions: Use a hierarchy of directories so that a directory only contains around 100-1000 files. Use Pack them all together in large files.

When I have time I will look into this myself sometime.

The numbers are from a Huawei Ideos X3 (600mhz, 265MB RAM) using a 8GB Class 2 MicroSD.
I'm from a university project developing our own route planing service. Map rendering became very slow i.e. start up time was very bad. Deleting the cache solved the problem.

I will try to replicate the problem and get better numbers as soon as I have time.
