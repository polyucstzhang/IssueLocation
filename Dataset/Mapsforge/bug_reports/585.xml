          At least on dev the changing tile size sample is broken. It seems that the persistent tile cache is getting in the way of properly drawing the screen with the right tiles.

          Just playing with it and turning the persistent cache off in the settings for samples makes the issue go away.

          So a clear cache has to take place (as with any other map model changes) ?

          With 7c67dcf I pushed a fix on dev adding a MapViewerTemplate.purgeTileCaches method for better handling persistent tile cache.
