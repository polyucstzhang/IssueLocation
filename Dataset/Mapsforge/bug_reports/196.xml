This is a feature request / code donation.
There's a patch attached that introduces a method zoomAndPan on the MapController which allows the user to zoom and pan to a region specified by providing extremal latitude and longitude values.

Attachment: ZoomAndPanTo.patch

When the mapview does not provide a valid width and height, the zoom level can not be computed of cause. So I would add a check at the top of the method, to check the width and height. And maybe a boolean return value to indicate whether the zoom and pan operation was successfull.

The naming is indeed wrong. This is a copy and past mistake. At first I wanted the user to provide the northeast and southwest geopoint of the area to zoom and pan to. After I changed my mind I copied the geopoint variables into the method body. To compute the width and height I just put the min values into the first geopoint and the max values into the other one for simplicity without thinking about the naming. So I suggest to rename the vaiables to southeast and northwest. Or to swap the lat values and adopt the compution accordingly.

I will post a new version when I'm back at work.

The upcoming 0.4.0 (aka "rewrite") version contains a completely new API regarding getting and setting of the map location. Many public class and method names have changed so that this patch can no longer be applied.

Status: WontFix
