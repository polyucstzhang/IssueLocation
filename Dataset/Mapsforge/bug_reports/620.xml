          Developers often have difficulties to perform proper clean up and our instructions contain many steps.
We should examine the option of providing a more simplified way for handling this.
Less grouped methods could suffice (with the needed internal checks).

          I stumbled over the problem that using the destroyAll() method requires overriding the destroyMapViews() method in the MapViewerTemplate, as otherwise a double destroy of the FramebufferController will cause a crash. 

I think this is somewhat undesirable.
