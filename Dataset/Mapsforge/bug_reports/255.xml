I run AVM r1826 project. 
After select file , I receive message: unsupport file version: 2
So that, I try to use method this.mapView.setMapFile("/sdcard/berlin.map") and return value is always false. (of course File path is correct and i created mapsforge-map-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar)
I have attached screenshots.
Why that?
Thanks so much !!

thanks so much ! AVM r1826 project was run!
Now I try creat a .map file by : 
follow the instructions https://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/wiki/MapFileWriterOsmosis (created .map file version 2 successful).
I replaced mapsforge-mapfile-writer-x.x.x.jar by mapsforge-map-writer-0.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in  directory "/home/prometheus/.openstreetmap/osmosis/plugins/" to create .map file version 3 but error.
I have attached screenshots.
Why that?
Thanks so much !!

I build the map-file-writer.jar on win7. After, i copy .jar file to ubuntu 10.04.
Is that cause?
You say  "The maven build also produces a jar file that includes all dependencies, so no need to install trove." but when I copy trove file to osmosis is still error but error is difference with no copy trove file?
Above is my two questions. 
And now, I am try build the map-file-writer.jar on ubuntu 10.04.
