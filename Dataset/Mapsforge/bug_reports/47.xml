What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. converted http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/europe/france/ile-de-france.osm.pbf to .map using osmosis mapwriter plugin
2. loaded map into AdvancedMapViewer 0.2.0 What is the expected output? What do you see instead? French accents (é, è, ...) don't display correctly (cf screenshort)
However, I'm not sure if this is a problem with the dataset, conversion, or display. What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? 0.2 / Nexus 1

I'm not able to reproduce the problem (see attached png).
Did the same on the same data as described in "What steps will reproduce the problem?".

My setup:


mapsforge-0.2.0
N1 with Android 2.2, Kernel 2.6.32.9.27227-g3c98b0d
Spracheinstellung auf N1: Deutsch
Host for converting file: Ubuntu 10.04
Java VM, 1.6.0_22


What was your exact setup, including the host on which the file has been converted?

Maybe we should try the following to track down the problem:
A: download brunoy.map (see attached files) which I converted on my machine. If it works the problem must be in the converter step. If the same problem occurs the problem must be in the MapViewer.

I cannot reproduce the problem. I just created a map file from the given pbf file (link in the initial comment) and the patched mapfile-writer (link in comment #4). The file is displayed without a problem and all accents look nice.

Test was done with an LG P500 with german language settings. Map file was created on an Ubuntu 10.04 (64 bit) system with OpenJDK 1.6.0_18 and Osmosis 0.37.
