*What steps will reproduce the problem?

I use a modified osmarender.xml, besides that I did not alter the rendering code.

*What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Some street names get fragmented or overlap. (See attachment.)
E.g.: _2208.png should display "Raoul Wallenberg utca"
Looks like clipped labels behave in a strange way at tile boundaries.

*What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?

0.3.0, Android 2.2

Well, to be honest I don't exactly know what "cache persistence" means... anyway, I guess it means that the .tile files don't get deleted when I exit the app.

If that's the case, then it's definitely not activated, as I checked that all .tile files vanish on exit.
