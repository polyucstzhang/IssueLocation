Related: Issue 127 ( https://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/issues/detail?id=127 )

There are still version 0.3.0 map files for some European countries missing on the ftp server. On first glance I found Denmark and Belgium missing. There might be more. I guess this is not high priority, but as developers are starting to transition away from 0.2.4 it would be nice to have them all.

I have added Thailand, unfortunately the cloudmade seem to have pivoted and do not do OSM related stuff any more, so the links to their download servers are outdated.

To add other regions I need a polygon file and a start point (which should be the center of the capital or the region)

Thailand should appear with next rendering at start of month.

Status: Started

          I pushed some changes on map-creator repository:


Rename back France centre to its OSM default.
Move France 'outside Europe regions' to inherit from planet osm. I tried to make them build inside the europe/france folder. Ludwig will this work?
Update the related polygons in case we had errors.
