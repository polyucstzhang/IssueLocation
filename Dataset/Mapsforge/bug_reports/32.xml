Thought a bit about pro's and cons of using Enum for the highway level tag.

In my opinion we should use a whitelist of strings instead of
the enum for importing the routing graph. 
The advantage of not using enums is that we don't need any changes inside the code for configuring the import. The highway level whitlist could be specified in a config file and no according enum must be created (saves work and removes redundancy). The same argument holds for EHighwayLevel2Speed. Here we could map strings to average speed instead of
mapping enums to average speed.

What do you think about this?

I totaly agree, too. Now we must think about, how to design this whitelist. Should we use only the value of the highwaylevel or is it necessary to use both(key+value)?
