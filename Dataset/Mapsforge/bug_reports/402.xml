Hi,
I downloaded the mapsforge map of Finland yesterday (7-Feb-2013) and noticed that mnay buildings (e.g. in Palokka, http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=62.29008&amp;lon=25.74699&amp;zoom=16 )are not shown. Seems that all buildings that are tagged as building=terrace or building=house (implemented through potlatch), are not shown. (some others like 'museum' were wrongly tagged at this place and I corrected those already in OSMpotlatch).
Could buildings with these kind of tags be included in the maps that can be downloaded from mapsforge?

Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/issues/detail?id=402

If I find some time, I might add more tags to the tag-mapping file, but you can quite easily add these things yourself. The file in question is the tag-mapping.xml somewhere under the writer directory.

Status: Accepted

Thanks for the adoption. I was looking at the file and I think that the following building tags are now duplicated.




Beside I found yesterday some railroad tags which are missing.
