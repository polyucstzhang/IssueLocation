Please provide the scripts to convert OSM maps to your map format.

Maybe we should integrate the converter into osmosis as a plugin. That would allow to
to integrate the processes of cutting out the region of interest from a larger OSM
raw data file and generating a map file.

A detailed tutorial with comments on all settings will be published as soon as possible. Before that some evaluation has to be done and some little issues have to be fixed. 
You will be immediately informed when our converting tools are in a stable version.
