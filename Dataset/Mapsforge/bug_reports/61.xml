Hi Guys, I followed ALL the steps trying to generate the .map and then I got stuck in 
"org.openstreetmap.osmosis.core.OsmosisRuntimeException: Task type mapfile-writer doesn't exist." even thought I created the folder in /home/andre/.openstreetmap/osmosis/plugin/ and dropped the mapfile plugin there

thanks in advance,
Andre Mariano

Hello Andre,

can you please provide the output of the following command:
ls -al /home/andre/.openstreetmap/osmosis/plugins/

Please print the full command how you are starting Osmosis ("bin/osmosis ...") with all the parameters for the mapfile-writer, maybe there is a typo somewhere.

(I assume you mean JTS 1.11 and not JTS 1.1)
