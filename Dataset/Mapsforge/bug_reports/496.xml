Up to now i was using mapsforge release 0.3.0 in my project.

The new release 0.4.0 seems to be not compatible at all with the 0.3.0.

Can you please update the wiki with some hints like GettingStarted with release 0.4.0,
i.e. how the Overlays have to be used ...
and how to migrate a project from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0.

Greetings
Benno

A step-by-step guide (or a simple checklist) would indeed be very helpful...
