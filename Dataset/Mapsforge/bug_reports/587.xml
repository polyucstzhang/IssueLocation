<BR><item><id>#587</id><title>Offline TileStore continuously ask for missing tile</title><description>

    
      
          Use the library v5 RC4.

If in the tile store there are some missing tile, the library always carry it continuously, 
It generate an active and infinite CPU consumption. 
See the bellow log for example:

INFO: Failed to find directory 


In the file "TileLayer.java", and more precisely in the "draw" method, 
it seem that the condition below recursively ask for redraw and so until bitmap is found
it always fire a file not found exception: 

if (waitingForCachedTiles) 
{
    this.requestRedraw();
}

          That seems a nice way to go.

 The change removes the busy wait for all TileLayers and makes the
 TileLayer only redraw when a change happens in the TileCache (i.e. a new
 tile is added). That should reduce CPU time for all TileLayers.
 (Drawback at the moment is that there might be changes happening to the
 tile cache that are not visible.)

tilecache changes

          Could do, but it could also be done in easily derived class....

 Yes usually a TileStore is created with a fixed tiles pyramid.
 I'm thinking of cases where we want to be flexible with that, e.g. apps
 where the tile store is being updated.
