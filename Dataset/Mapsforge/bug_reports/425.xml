Hi,


The map scale bar seems to draw out of screen, a part of it. This happens at Honeycomb devices, at JB devices is almost completely out.
Also at each redraw of scale bar, its canvas does not erases but remain traces of the old scale text and lines.
I think that at line 126 of MapScaleBar class the statement
this.mapScaleCanvas.fillColor(Color.TRANSPARENT);
does not work as it is intended. At main branch the eraseColor method is used and clears the canvas at each redraw.

Hi,

Another thing that may be needed is to add
this.redrawNeeded = true;
at the end of scale bar's setAdapter method (as it was at main branch).
Now if we change adapter, the change takes effect during the next zoom only and not immediately.

Regards.

You are right, I just added that missing line. Thanks for reporting!
