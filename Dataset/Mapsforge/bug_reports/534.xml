What steps will reproduce the problem?
Get attached ZoomToBounds.java
and Update ZoomToBounds class in Samples projects.
Start "ZoomToBounds" sample

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?


The markers will always appear outside the MapView area. 


What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
0.4.3
0.5.0-rc1
0.5.0-rc2

Please provide any additional information below.


Try to uncomment 

dimension = new Dimension((int)(dimension.width / 2f), (int)(dimension.height / 2f));

Markers will be displayed inside the area

What's wrong ?

Since you're playing with the code and the Samples app has changed,
can you check this issue using the latest dev?

I have pushed at dev a fixed / improved formula in the LatLongUtils.zoomForBounds method.
Can you check it and report any issues you may have?

Could you please post this issue (with the picture) at mailing list where it'll get better visibility and we can continue the discussion?

It's related to another mapsforge mechanism, so I'll close this issue if there is no objection.
