What steps will reproduce the problem? 1.Extract bbox 42.72/2.81 42.30/3.40 from europe.osm.pbf (geofabrik)
2.Convert to .map file with standards options What is the expected output? What do you see instead? The map is partially incomplete and the background is visible for zoom 8/11 What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? Writer 0.4.0 or 0.5.0-rc2
Linux ubuntu 14-04 Please provide any additional information below. With the same PBF file and with way-clipping=false the map is correct for all zoom levels

I have the same problem with the latest dev version (today)
The fix is in the writer or in the reader ?

With this dev version I encounter the same behavior as # issue 526 with roundabouts

Thanks
