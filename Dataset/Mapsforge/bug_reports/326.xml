I use FolderSync for Android to keep the maps on my device up to date. FolderSync only works with FTP servers so I was glad I found ftp.mapsforge.org in Google.

Will the FTP access vanish over the time or do both machines work in parallel?

The link above was something I found that I thought could help solve the problem. However I just run my program again and all work out fine so the problem is no longer available. I believe you can close this issue.
