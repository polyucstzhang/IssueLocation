We decided to move the generation of closed (water and land) polygons from the map library to the mapfile-writer. We should be able to use our existing Java implementation for that, which is currently located in the android.maps package.

As the coastline algorithm is no longer executed by the map renderer, many water areas and islands will be missing until we have fixed this.

The mentioned message with explanations on the coastline-aware version on the mapsforge-dev mailinglist can be found here: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/mapsforge-dev/t-_zxJ0if-s/discussion

          There is now a companion project to mapsforge at https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge-mapcreator that includes the water areas correctly by implementing an approach that has been discussed on our mailing list. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/mapsforge-dev/Missing$20water$3A$20a$20work-around$20solution/mapsforge-dev/x54kHlyKiBM/jUK4oRHvHUEJ.

Using an external coast line set is preferable to duplicating this effort in mapsforge, so I am closing this issue.
