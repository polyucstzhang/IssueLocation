The map library should highlight streets which have a "oneway=yes" tag ( http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:oneway ) with little arrow symbols, so that the restriction is clearly visible. Mapnik and Osmarender do that already for a long time.

I created patch for oneway rendering.
Patch marks ways with the oneway flag in map file. Currently supports oneway tag with following values: yes, 1, true.
Additional tags can be added in TileData file.

In addition I added rendering for oneway tag and ref tag (road number).

We now support rewriting of tags ( r1018 ). It has been exemplarily added to the tag-mapping.xml for the oneway tag.

We should apply the third patch of Andrzej and adjust the parts where the oneway information is read from the database. I guess the semantic of oneway=-1 is not yet recognized in the implemention, correct me. The parts of the patch regarding the mapfile-writer can now completely be disregarded.

Since revision r1024 it is now possible to align symbols along ways centered and top-left. This new feature is already in use to draw symbols at ways with an aerialway=chair_lift tag correctly.
