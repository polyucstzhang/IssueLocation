With the new overlay implementation ( issue #286 ) the existing API has changed. The current code base does not yet offer a way to react on touch events and interact with overlay items. This needs to be added again as many applications require such a feature.

Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/issues/detail?id=336

I'm keen to see some way to detect various events.

1) Detecting when the map center or zoom level has changed is one feature i need.

2) Obviously, like a lot of other mapsforge users, i require some touch events for OverlayItems.

Thanks.

Hi, this feature is important for the completion of one of my projects. 

has anyone got a workaround for it or the code for the above workaround?

Any news on when this issue will be tackled?

Could I help in any way? Testing?

Thanks ,

Hello, since I tought that more people would like to have the touch in the rewrite branch, here is a litte patch for simple tap.

It is all based on j...@lapoutre.com's Patch but compatible with the latest rewrite. 
Please remember, it's quick'n'dirty but at least works for a while...

Cheers, Stephan

Thanks!
