What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. Open simple map
2. Move very fast map with fingers and click zoom in, zoom out buttons very fast while map is gray and loading, try moving map to left and right very intensivly
3. Click and tap the map fast - the result ANR (Application not responding) Deydispatching timeout What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Map should be lpaded What version of the product are you using? On what operating system? 0.3.1 Please provide any additional information below. I know that this is fixed in some cases, but during FIRST LOAD it is not fixed. When TIle Cache initializes  it freeze somehow when you intensivly move the "not-yet-loaded-gray-map" and it leeds to ANR

Thanks for re-reporting this. It looks like it was a mistake to assume this was fixed with the patch. 

Can you produce a stack-trace for when it hangs? If I get a stack-trace I should be able to make a patch before the end of the year.

I have information from reliable sources (Thilo) that the whole rendering chain is being reworked with the aim of taking much more processing off the UI thread. That should fix this issue, so I will not investigate this separately any further.

Status: Accepted
