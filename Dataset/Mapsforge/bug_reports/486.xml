Hi,

I am using mapsforge library. I want to implement feature to move Overlay with finger. To implement this feature it is required to have { public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event, MapView mapView)} method in the ItemizedOverlay class. But I am not able to get this method when overriding in Eclipse. 

Has anybody faced this problem? ...please help me

I tried another approach, I downloaded the source code using git bash. But surprisingly I could not find ItemizedOverlay class. Is this source not updated in downloads section?

Thanks in advance.

Thanks for the prompt reply. Can you please provide java source code for mapsforge-map-0.3.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar ?

There is support for the required method in 0.4.x. 
0.3 is not supported anymore, so I am closing this issue.
