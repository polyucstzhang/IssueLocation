          Using LabelLayer with a map filled with grid based symbols, if we zoom in / out then only some map tiles are filled again with the symbols.

Often after pan / zoom we have empty areas and we need to move slightly the map in order to trigger a redraw.

          And it occurs on Android, LabelLayer seems working fine on Java.

          I see we scan map view's all visible tiles but many come up empty in TileBasedLabelStore.getVisibleItems (though they shouldn't), probably in a racing condition as this is totally random.

I associate it with MapWorkerPool job, where only the TileRendererLayer is triggered to redraw and not the LabelLayer.
