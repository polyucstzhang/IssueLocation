<extraction><id>#107</id><title>choose between AsyncTask and IntentService/AsyncTaskLoader</title><description> Hello, I'm doing research on Android async programming. I see in irccloud-android, you use IntentService at some places (such as GCMIntentService) while use AsyncTask at other places (such as in NetworkConnection). I'm wondering how do you choose between AsyncTask and IntentService? because both are used to execute background tasks.As far as I know, some articles (for example this article) mention that AsyncTask leads to memory leak and losing task result when there's a configuration change (such as orientation change). But using IntentService or AsyncTaskLoader can avoid such problems.</description><comments>AsyncTask is for background tasks that complete within the app, IntentService is for background services that run while the app is closed (GCM is for push notifications)</comments></extraction>
