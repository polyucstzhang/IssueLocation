Android version: 4.4.4 Nexus 5When I tap and hold on a message, the menu with options to copy the message, whois the sender, etc comes up. This is normal.When I let up my finger from this tap, and there is a link in the message I tapped, AND I tapped+held directly on the link - it acts as if I simply tapped the link. So if I want to copy a message with a link, my browser pops up, I need the tap the system Back button, then Copy Message.The expected behavior is that any message I tap and hold only brings up the Copy Message, Whois, etc menu, and doesn't open the link.</description><comments>This should be fixed in 09ed0e4 but I'll keep the ticket open until it's tested on more devices</comments></extraction>
