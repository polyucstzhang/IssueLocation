However, on the Google Play store when I view Google Play services it says "Your device isn't compatible with this version".My device, a Nexus 6 has Google Play services 6.7.74, running on Android 5.1.</description><comments>The latest version of Google Play Services is 7.0 and was pushed out to devices a month ago, not sure why it's not available for your device in the Play Store, you'd have to ask Google. Do you have any reporting that may indicate if other users are also on a older Play Services? Presumably the latest version of irccloud is using features only available in 7.0?</comments></extraction>
