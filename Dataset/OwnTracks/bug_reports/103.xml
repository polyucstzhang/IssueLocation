Waypoints was wiped after the update, So I went and tried to import a saved config I had on Dropbox, Owntracks crashed after confirming the import (and no waypoint was imported) Yeah, sorry about this. The 0.5.11 release is quite broken because I forgot
to actually merge in many changes before building the release.
0.5.12 is in the works. @binarybucks No problem! I just wanted to report this, thanks for all the work you and everybody contributing is doing. @juzam thank you for confirming the import crashes the app; @binarybucks just didn't want to believe me! :-) :-)</comments></extraction>
