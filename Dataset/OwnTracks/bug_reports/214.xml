I have to save it and open it from the explorer using owntracks. Would be nice if this is possible directly from the mail application.</description><comments>Works fine here with the latest master channel. When tapping on an .otrc file in Dropbox or the Gmail, Android offers to open the file with OwnTracks. Could you specify which app version you are refering to and with which app you are trying to open the .otrc file? 0.5.16, tried from gmail &amp; k-9 mail.

Hosted files are exported with application/json MIME type that was previously not associated with the app. </comments></extraction>
