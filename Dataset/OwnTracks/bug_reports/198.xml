Works fine here. This could happen if a geofence transition occurs but the app cannot find a defined waypoint for the geofence id. As I'm seeing some database errors for you I'd suggest you try with the next version which should correctly setup the database. Ok - will do - any idea when that next release might be?</comments></extraction>
