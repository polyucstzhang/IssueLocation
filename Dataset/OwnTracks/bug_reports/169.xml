<extraction><id>#169</id><title>Battery charging status</title><description> The battery status is a nice information, but in order to be really useful, it should have also a "charging status".So I could forget about my phone, and only receive notifications when its discharging bellow some level.Now, when I activate battery alarm, I receive a lot of alarms even with my phone connected and charging.Regards</description><comments>Thanks for your feedback. While this might indeed be a cool feature, we will currently not implement this; we think alerting on low-batt should be enough. ;-)</comments></extraction>
