Originally opened as binarybucks/mqttitude#310Bryan Boyd just asked on Twitter:any way to create a geofence at any location, without having published at the location previously?This is possible on Android, but not on iOS. Maybe we could think about that as a feature request.</description><comments>Comment by bryancboyd from Thursday Jan 30, 2014 at 17:32 GMTMany thanks!  This would come in handy when defining large sets of waypoints/geofences... I've got a project in mind that would use this. Comment by ckrey from Saturday Feb 01, 2014 at 11:09 GMTDone in IOS. Will be available in App Store 5.7 or already now on github Comment by jpmens from Saturday Feb 01, 2014 at 14:03 GMTTesting in the simulator.</comments></extraction>
