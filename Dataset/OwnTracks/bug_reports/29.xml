Originally opened as binarybucks/mqttitude#307As you know, in IOS the App does not run in background, but is woken up by IOS only if location updates occur.This may lead to the situation where location messages are produced but not transmitted because the app is not woken up after a temporary network problem (server down, transition from Wifi to mobile, ... you name it).To solve this problem, the app will now (&gt;= version 5.6) set an alarm like the calendar or  reminder app to remind the user of the fact. </description><comments>Comment by ckrey from Tuesday Jan 28, 2014 at 13:26 GMTDone, will be available with v5.6</comments></extraction>
