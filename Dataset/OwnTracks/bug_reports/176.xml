If this is not the place to place this comments, please let me know.When defining a waypoint, there is now an icon that replaces the old CURRENT button. I found this very unintuitive, maybe is the location far from the fields. Perhaps a hint for new users?The new app is WAY better! Keep going the great work!Thanks</description><comments>Hi, thanks for the feedback. To be honest I've yet to find a good idea to input the location. In the future we'll probably use the Google provided location picker that allows you to search for locations and drag a pin around the map. I tested it but recently it was not ready for production use as there were several graphical glitches. I think the new picker will make it much easier and more intuitive to pick the location. Until then I probably won't change it as it works and there are other areas that need improvement first. </comments></extraction>
