That would require a new user only to enter name, device name and the location of his server - everything else could be configured automatically ? ... this could also be used to send TLS information as part of a 'welcome' message.  @jwende Have you seen https://github.com/owntracks/owntracks/wiki/RemoteConfigThis is on iOS already, and will be coming to Android in due course. Sorry, I missed that. It is even better - thanks ! Any plan to add this remote/file config provisioning on Android? It's planned, yes, but unless we receive code contributions, it won't happen anytime soon. Excactly. I've temporarily ceased development for both work and private
reasons. I see, excellent work so far so I hope you can be back soon! I'll see if anything can be done from here but we don't have great experience with Android dev Setup wizzard will be dropped in favor of config import. </comments></extraction>
