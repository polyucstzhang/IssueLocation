I do not have a username or password on my server, but it seems that if I enter some text into those fields then the connect button works.</description><comments>Please go to Preferences-&gt;Advanced and check Enable advanced connection preferences. 
Afterwards you can chose Anonymous auth in the connection preferences to connect without username/password. Please note: You have to enter the username in any case, even if your broker does not require it as some internal things like the PUB topic depend on its presence. If auth is set to anonymous your credentials are just not send to the broker. This is also documented in https://github.com/owntracks/owntracks/wiki/Android  Doh, Sorry about that, thanks for your help!</comments></extraction>
