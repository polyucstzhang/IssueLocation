Would you suggest any additional information on the Play Store description or the wiki to get users started? For the link in the app: make sure it says 'Documentation'.For the Play Store: how about something like "OwnTracks requires an MQTT server (broker?), either existing or your own." - perhaps even with a link to the Wiki so people know what they are getting into.</comments></extraction>
