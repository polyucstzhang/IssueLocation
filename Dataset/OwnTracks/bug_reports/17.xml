Originally opened as binarybucks/mqttitude#246I see 5.4 PUBlishes all stored waypoints on startup. Didn't we decide against that?</description><comments>Comment by ckrey from Friday Jan 03, 2014 at 23:11 GMTYes we did. The change was kind of 'undone' when when I stopped the pins 'flying in'.Fixed Comment by jpmens from Saturday Jan 11, 2014 at 11:22 GMTLooking good, @ckrey : old waypoints are no longer transmitted upon start in 5.5. thank you.</comments></extraction>
