currently the sending of the ping message is (re)scheduled after a) a ping
message is send or b) after a message is received.
So if you're not seeing a ping message it could be because you've been
sending a message before.

That being said, the whole ping system and BrokerService in general is
quite fragile. I'm waiting for the next paho release before I refactor it
with more appropriate code that also can send pings natively. Thx Alex for the clarification.</comments></extraction>
