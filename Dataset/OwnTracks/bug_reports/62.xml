It seems to work (and I'll write it up soon enough).The problem I ran into is that in the process of doing this I generated a lot of test data, and that's clogging up my Android application (with non-moving trains that I'm not updating ever again). I looked at the server that I'm connected to, to verify that these are not retained messages on the server, so they seem to be on my phone.Can I just nuke a db and start afresh?</description><comments>You can indeed nuke the db and restart. Do note though, that it'll kill any waypoints you've configured, as well as your settings, of course.  Other than that, no problem. Thanks! An uninstall and reinstall also did the trick. The app does not store location data in any form of database. You just have
to force kill and relaunch it and it will pull all new data from the
server. The only thing stored are preferences and waypoints. Waypoints can
also be deleted through the GUI. Closing, this problem is solved!</comments></extraction>
