<extraction><id>#65</id><title>Write tracks to GPX-File instead of using MQTT</title><description> Hi,I am using and developing some software, which is able to work with MyTracks. It would be nice to use this software with OwnTracks as well. In MyTracks, I can export a route as GPX file[1]. Such files can then be imported into various other software. It would be awesome to have the same ability in OwnTracks. (I've also posted the same issue for the IOS App[2])Kind Regards![1]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format / http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_Exchange_Format
