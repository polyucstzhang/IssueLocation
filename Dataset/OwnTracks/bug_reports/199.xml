Report sent.</description><comments>Whom did you send the report to? Slack? (Just kidding :-)  Don't know - just clicked Report on the exception dialog! Funnily, if I export to Slack, OwnTracks lives but Slack crashes :D  Yep - not a big deal this one - once I figured out I could export to email OK I was happy :). It crashes Slack but not OwnTracks so it's not our problem.</comments></extraction>
