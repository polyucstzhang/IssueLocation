<extraction><id>#25</id><title>[CLOSED] iOS: is this a communications error?</title><description> Issue by jpmens from Thursday Jan 16, 2014 at 12:53 GMT
Originally opened as binarybucks/mqttitude#269Had my phone (jpm/5s) in my pocket until 13:34, when I launched the app. I know that some "friends" had published locations until then (watching broker).Friends list didn't show the updates, i.e. old timestamps on the Friends list.I pressed PUB on the app (and my current location was published). I then returned to the Friends list to see new timestamps, i.e. updated locations.Help me understand this, please.MQTT communication works, as can be seen in the attached broker log. PUBs were transmitted during the evening of the 15th, and those arrived at the broker. However, PUBs by friends to the same broker never reached the phone, at least they weren't ACKed until 13:34:28, just after I explicitly PUB.Is this a bug?</description><comments>Comment by ckrey from Thursday Jan 16, 2014 at 19:54 GMTIf you did not move between 07:06 and 13:34 I don't see an error.Your device did not connect to the broker and therefore the broker had no chance to
forward the messages of your friends.When you bring up the app, it does not connect automatically, only if a new publish is queued.
This will change when #266 is in the app store.Did your friends publish new locations between 07:06 and 13:34? Comment by jpmens from Thursday Jan 16, 2014 at 20:01 GMTMy friends did publish location in that timeframe, and I also moved,
although maybe not enough to have the phone detect it as movement. I'll keep an eye on it. Comment by jpmens from Tuesday Jan 28, 2014 at 14:22 GMTLooks ok at the moment. Closing this.</comments></extraction>
