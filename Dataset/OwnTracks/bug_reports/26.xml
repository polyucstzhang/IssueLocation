<extraction><id>#26</id><title>[CLOSED] Friends UI has /waypoint PUBs in it</title><description> Issue by jpmens from Tuesday Jan 21, 2014 at 09:28 GMT
Originally opened as binarybucks/mqttitude#292When a friend publishes (shares) a waypoint, this is done on .../waypoint as we recently discussed. What then obviously happens, is that iPhone considers these PUBs to be "a new friend" ;-)This isn't a bug (actually could even be considered a feature -- waypoints seen separately from normal location reports) and, apart from ignoring those (subscribe to mqttitude/+/+ instead of to mqttitude/#) I can't think of a clean way to hide them, except by ignoring _type=waypoint in the Friends list.This screen shot shows what I mean:Thoughts, @ckrey ?</description><comments>Comment by ckrey from Tuesday Jan 21, 2014 at 09:37 GMTOn the map view, your friends shared waypoints are shown as a) pictures with a BLUE circle
b) a normal green pin if no picture is assignedIf you decide to subscribe to them (mqttitude/#), why would you want to hide them? They are your friends and they decided to share the waypoints!If you want to be more specific you may adjust visibility in the acl of the server (allow mqttitude/angel/waypoints, disallow mqttitude/evil/waypoints) Comment by jpmens from Tuesday Jan 21, 2014 at 09:39 GMTI know all that, thanks. I was talking about the friends list only. Comment by ckrey from Tuesday Jan 21, 2014 at 09:43 GMTOk, are you using 5.5 or the preview from github?In 5.6. waypoints are NOT shown as a separate friend. Is that what you mean? Comment by jpmens from Tuesday Jan 21, 2014 at 09:47 GMT5.5Probably, yes. Comment by ckrey from Saturday Jan 25, 2014 at 14:26 GMTClosed with 5.6</comments></extraction>
