I tried long-press (as I did in, say, friends list) in order to see details / assign face/name, but nothing happened.Sometime later, by mistake, I tapped (short press), and bingo!This may be confusing to others. 0.5.04</description><comments>It's long press in the contacts list and long press on the white card thing on the map. Neither is a press on the face itself :p Tap on face on map. ... after which white card thing pops up. Jup. When you long tap that it takes you to the contacts context menu like everywhere else on Android, doesn't it? When I long press the white card thing, yes.I was expecting to be able to long-press the face. I guess all I'm saying is long-press and tap (on the face) should bring up the white card thing.
