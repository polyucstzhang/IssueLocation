Please elaborate. :) http://f-droid.org/it's an "app market" (for lack of a better description) for open-source Android apps.They have their own build infrastructure to make sure that the distributed packages are really built from public sources and their installer app, so submission basically consists of Sorry, but we don't have the resources to do this at the moment. We're now considering this if we can find suitable replacements for the Google Play Services without crippling functionality.  you can also just create your own repo https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Setup_an_FDroid_App_Repo as I have done quick and dirty especially for owntracks http://fdroid.rekmp.net/repo to be up2date on family devices. I guess, that would only be the second-best option, also it requires more and additional effort... Hey! F-Droid dev here. If you want to publish on our main repo, which requires building from source, you'd have to get rid of the third party maven repositories (we only allow maven central and jcenter for now) and the binary aar in libs/.Alternatively, like other say, you can just set up your own F-Droid repository. You can just feed it apks directly, without having to worry about building your app with our fdroidserver tools. Thanks for your response. Please see my comment over at #88 so we don't have to keep an eye on two threads. </comments></extraction>
