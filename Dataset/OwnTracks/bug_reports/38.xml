We decided to do that for privacy reasons, in case you don't want people who share your broker to see you've entered, ahm, your gym or some place. ;-) I also did't get the waypoint description with shared option active. Are you gentlemen using latest Beta from store, or the .apk from the repository? Is that a final decision? I would argue you have enough control over your
location data using OwnTracks without the app deciding what should be
published or not. @sumnerboy12 You get to chose: just share the waypoint. Isn't that the decision you're looking for? It's not the app, but the user who decides. I see you were faster than me. See #36The current behaviour is a bug because I derped yesterday. Independently of the share setting, 0.4.17 does not send  a desc. Will fix it this evening.  The Beta from Store
 If that's 0.4.17 there is a bug in it, as @binarybucks said above: desc is missing from location reports (in spite of you having shared a waypoint). Fix is in the making! :-) Ok cheers guys - I will wait for 0.4.18 to arrive.  Confirm 0.4.18 adds desc on events.  Yep - confirmed it is working here as well. Thanks!</comments></extraction>
