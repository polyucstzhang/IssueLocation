Hit up-arrow: there is no vibration or other visual indication that PUB has been done (though it is). Also: time on said bar remains constant.</description><comments>Published tst remains constant as well: While on Locations page: similar results when pressing Report Now. published tsts remain constant although i notice the reverse geocoder blink.After a few presses, phone vibrates and says "Location reported", and tst increases. When you report it queries the Google API for the last known location. If you do this many times in a row, the same cached location object is returned from the API. The location message includes the tst at which the location was acquired. I can change it to use the time at which the message was send. Thinking about it, this is probably also the reason for your reports of duplicate messages in #86  I think current time is more intuitive.</comments></extraction>
