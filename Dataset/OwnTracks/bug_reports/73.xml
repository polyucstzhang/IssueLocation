@GeorgeHahn can you create a new pull request based on the current master branch that enables or disables ranging based on Preferences.getBeaconRangingEnabled() ? For application startup basically just move the ServiceBeacon init part into a new method and call it in onCreate based on getBeaconRangingEnabled. Then setup a preference change listener on R.strings.beaconRangingEnabled and either call the init method if ranging was disabled or disable ranging if it was enabled (I guess there's a stopRangingBeaconsInRegion method or similar?).  Add preference for custom Layout </description><comments>Continued from #71, I think it would be best to give the user control over the scan/between scan periods.I'll figure out how to stop ranging tomorrow.</comments></extraction>
