Ad a test i've installed a bitcoin wallet app and with that installed no crash and the bitcoin app is launched. A test if there's any app capable of opening bitcoin "urls" may solve the problem. (I didn't look at the code tho) Ah yes. I thought Android would handle that for me. Naive me.

It's easy to catch but what shall we do if no app is installed? I'd just
copy the address into the clipboard and show a notification popup (toast).
