22 character limit is a copy paste bug from the device name aka client id
that is limited to 22 characters per spec. Will be fixed in the next
release.It's now called device name for the not so MQTT savy people thanks! and can we also make deviceID the same length as username? 22 is the limit per spec, sry. oops, my bad. thanks! From what I hear, the 22 character limit is to be raised in future specs. The Paho library doesn't support more (yet). Once that changes I'll adapt
the limits accordingly. when are we pushing a new version to the play store??? (i guess i'm a nag) I'm not seeing this as a critical issue, so the fix will be included in the 0.4.22 together with some other improvements. ETA: Probably once other issues are ironed out (#47, #11, #50) err, the app can't connect to my broker because of this, so i'd classify it as "critical" I suggest to chose a shorter username then for the time being ;)  I for one would appreciate English instead of Latin in the comments. if this is fixed, could you push 0.4.22 to the play store?  if not, could you reopen it?</comments></extraction>
